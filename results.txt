" Puzzling or contested features a The virus is easily spread and by multiple routes (droplet, aerosol, contact) What explains striking geographic differences of incidence? Many infected persons are asymptomatic, a smaller number require hospitalization, and even fewer develop respiratory failure What explains highly variable mortality rates, site-to-site? Children are affected less often and usually less severely than adults, yet may have rare post-infectious complications related to previous vascular invasion Are there different COVID-19 genetic types and virulence, perhaps due to its RNA mutations? Mortality rates are higher among those with diabetes, hypertension, chronic heart or lung disease, the elderly, and the morbidly obese Can we develop an effective vaccine against variants of COVID and distribute it worldwide? How long will such a vaccine be effective? So-called 'silent hypoxemia' may precede overt respiratory distress Are there inflammatory versus non-inflammatory phenotypes of CARDS? Unusually high minute ventilation and high dead space may be evident from the outset What role does 'cytokine storm' play in the clinical presentations of COVID-19? Abrupt deterioration often occurs after days of smoldering infection Do symptomatic patients who present with severe hypoxemia sort into ""L and H"" phenotypes? Respiratory system compliance is not invariably low in the presence of severe hypoxemia Do patients progress to diffuse airspace disease via patient self-inflicted lung injury (PSILI)? Incidence of blood clotting appears to be high in hospitalized COVID-19 patients Does the fact that CARDS patients meet the Berlin definition mean that these patients will respond to standard approaches and guidelines for ARDS? Early CT infiltrates occurring in severely hypoxemic patients are often scant, peripheral, and characterized by atypical 'ground glass' or 'crazy paving' Does disrupted vasoregulation with minor shunt explain the severity of early hypoxemia? Prone positioning and PEEP improve PaO 2 /FiO 2 Should full anticoagulation be routinely implemented?
