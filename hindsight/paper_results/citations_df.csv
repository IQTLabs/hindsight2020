"In US hospital patients, COVID-19 prevalence was slightly higher in individuals with non-O-type blood; blood type affected both risk of mechanical ventilation (lower in type A, higher in B and AB compared to O) and death (higher in AB, lower in A and B compared to O), and Rh negative status was protective for all three measures.",edf1f6e3086ea76ed35a49975aadb881408ca710,11/13/20,Nat Commun,,15.
