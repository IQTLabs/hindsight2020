Children are affected less often and usually less severely than adults, yet may have rare post-infectious complications related to previous vascular invasion Are there different COVID-19 genetic types and virulence, perhaps due to its RNA mutations?

How long will such a vaccine be effective? So-called 'silent hypoxemia' may precede overt respiratory distress Are there inflammatory versus non-inflammatory phenotypes of CARDS? Unusually high minute ventilation and high dead space may be evident from the outset What role does 'cytokine storm' play in the clinical presentations of COVID-19? Abrupt deterioration often occurs after days of smoldering infection Do symptomatic patients who present with severe hypoxemia sort into ""L and H"" phenotypes? Respiratory system compliance is not invariably low in the presence of severe hypoxemia Do patients progress to diffuse airspace disease via patient self-inflicted lung injury (PSILI)?

Children with both severe and moderate initial symptoms can progress to MIS-C.	"Although MIS-C has been highlighted in children infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has been linked to poor prognosis [10] , the multiple organ dysfunctions that the neonate in our case study had can be explained by her severe persistent pulmonary hypertension status and hemodynamic instability, especially with lack of skin manifestation, fever, and other signs and symptoms that exist in MIS-C"

"Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown."	"In addition, the antibody response in recovered COVID-19 patients has been shown to decline 98 several months after infection, raising concerns that therapeutics or vaccines designed to elicit 99 primarily neutralizing antibody responses may not be sufficient to engender the cellular immunity 100 required for long-term duration of protection or to protect from potential repeat infections 25"

"Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown."	"There are recent preliminary studies that report the absence of seroconversion in mildly infected patients [10] and short duration of antibody-mediated immunity in asymptomatic patients [8] , both of which can impede the performance of serological assays and result in underestimation of COVID-19 infections in the population"
"Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown."	"Do IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgE, and perhaps other immunoglobulins produced against infection with the virus actually neutralize the virus (protect against it)? Do antibodies to the virus persist? As antibody titer decreases with time could viral recrudescence occur and periodic outbreaks or epidemics follow? Is reinfection of humans possible? Is ""spillback"" (from humans or other vertebrates to bats) possible and significant? Do the peculiarities of this particular virus bring about antibody-dependent enhancement, making patient survival or uncomplicated recovery less likely? Will a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 complicate or even counteract its intent? Might latent infections in newborn or young children lead to virus persistence through life, as with varicellazoster virus? Are there racial and gender differences in susceptibility? Do X chromosomes influence susceptibility and severity of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2? What are the host and virus characteristics of infections leading to partial protection (with virus shedding)? For how long does a SARS-CoV-2-infected human shed virus, from pre-symptomatic to post-symptomatic (if recovered)? For how long does an asymptomatic human shed virus? How much virus? Is SARS-CoV-2 shed only from mucous membranes? How about from feces? Can the virus be sexually transmitted? Should re-examination of poorly diagnosed illnesses be done to rule out a SARS-CoV-2 causation? Why are older patients and particularly those with co-morbidities more prone to die with this infection, as has been shown to occur with Middle East respiratory coronavirus? Of 175 Chinese patients with mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, 70% developed strong antibody responses, but about 25% had poor responses and about 5% developed no detectable antibody"

"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	"Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive plasma samples strongly recognized the spike and nucleocapsid proteins from specific human seasonal coronaviruses, suggesting prior exposure to these other coronaviruses may induce partially protective responses against SAR-CoV-2"
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	"We confirmed that the assay is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 and displays lack of cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses"
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	Initial concerns about potential cross-reactivity of seasonal coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays resulted in FDA recommendations for inclusion of a disclaimer
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	Thus the results point to the potential of non-cross-reactivity between antibodies against these seasonal coronaviruses and the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the study participants
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."

"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	"Moreover, a subset of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 might not develop long-lasting antibodies to the virus, and S-antibodies were reported to rapidly decline for people infected with seasonal coronaviruses and who recovered from COVID-19, especially those with mild symptoms or asymptomatic infection (10)"
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	"One hypothesis is that cross reactive immune responses, elicited by prior 46 infection with seasonal coronaviruses impacts the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, perhaps 47 providing a degree of protection against severe COVID-19 disease"
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."	"Both SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays demonstrated 100% specificity and no cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses, and therefore this does not account for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody pre-CP"
"Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein."

Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable.	"With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable."
Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable.	In-Person screening should always commence by recording temperature using a non-contact thermometer followed by a screening questionnaire to determine if they have had COVID-19 symptoms
Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable.	"27, 46 Screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms and recording their body temperature is essential"

The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results.	"Can automation, together with new technologies, make a difference from conventional clinical microbiology tests that often require a significant amount of manual work? What impact will such advancements have in clinical routine in terms of sample-to-result timing, taking into account that it usually takes between 24 and 48 h to obtain results in current routine laboratories (Ruppéet al., 2016) ? What will such new technologies imply in terms of resources and management? Lastly, can we understand and interpret multimodal largevolume data resulting from these new technologies? In this mini review, we will discuss these questions leveraging the benefits of technological advancements over routine diagnostics but also considering the limitations and problems by implementing them in healthcare facilities"

"We developed a stochastic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics (described in greater detail in the Supplement) to simulate the temporal distribution of transmission events, the heterogeneity of peak viral burden and infectivity within the patient population, the timing of clinical presentation and diagnostic results, the dependence of assay detection on viral burden at the time of testing, and the resulting transmission avertable by a given diagnostic approach"
"Low viral loads can lead to false-negative RT-PCR tests, and viral loads are lower in late stage infections as well as at the end of a given day."	One troubling possibility for individual health and slowing the spread of the disease is that low viral loads at the onset of infection may account for a large share of false-negative RT-PCR results
"Low viral loads can lead to false-negative RT-PCR tests, and viral loads are lower in late stage infections as well as at the end of a given day."

Telework policies may reduce new cases.	"Telework has been promoted for decades as one of the traffic demand management policies to alleviate congestion during peak periods and reduce work-related trips, along with other benefits"
Telework policies may reduce new cases.	"They have incorporated our estimates of telework, and also include government expenditures on health care and some countervailing fiscal policies, such as unemployment compensation and tax relief, all of which dampen the negative impacts"
Telework policies may reduce new cases.	"However, teleworking policies must be regularly evaluated and be dynamic to stay relevant to respond to the changing needs in the context of emergency situations"
Telework policies may reduce new cases.	"These policies should consider the employers' and the employees' experience regarding what work tasks were performed remotely in a smooth way and what should be improve, and what and how are the jobs have been transitioned to teleworking"
