The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. #
Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses, animals exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and modeling estimates, the median infectious dose is likely between 10 and 1,000 viral particles (plaque-forming units, PFU). #
A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaques via combination intranasal and intratracheal exposure (106 TCID50 total dose). #580
Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (delivered through several routes), while marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1x106 PFU intranasally. #422
Rhesus macaques are effectively infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a dose of ~700,000 PFU (106 TCID50).#164 
Rhesus macaques infected with 2,600,000 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human disease.#469 
A small study infected Rhesus macaques via ocular inoculation (1x106 TCID50), resulting in mild infection; however, gastric inoculation did not result in infection (same dose), suggesting a limited role of gastric transmission.Interpretation is limited due to the small scale.#163
African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intranasal and intratracheal routes), mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposures between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU.#71,734,280
Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all animals with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.#321
Rhesus macaques have been suggested as the best non-human primate model of human COVID-19.#421 
Infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from rhesus macaque feces, suggesting possible fecal-oral transmission.#771
The SARS-CoV-2 median infectious dose in Golden Syrian hamsters via the intranasal route was experimentally estimated at 5 TCID50 (~3.5 PFU).#584 
Low-dose intranasal inoculation of ferrets (2,000 PFU) and Golden Syrian hamsters (1,800 PFU) with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in mild clinical symptoms, the production of infectious virus, and seroconversion.#459
Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters infected).#618 
Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies, and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages.#120
Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID50 (~630-756 PFU).#54 
All mice (4/4) exposed for 25-30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0-20 minutes (up to 720 TCID50, ~504 PFU).#54 
Ferrets infected with 316,000 TCID50339 or 600,000 TCID50572 of SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.#339, 572 
Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post-contact.#339 
In a separate ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.#592
The infectious dose of a pathogen can be estimated by the amount of genetic material passed between an infector and infectee (called “bottleneck” size.#627 
using epidemiological data, sequencing data, and statistics, the average “bottleneck” size for SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated as ~1,200 viral particles, though exposure routes were not possible to identify.#543
Modeling aerosol exposures from 5 case studies suggests the inhalation ID50 for SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 361-2,000 viral particles, which is approximately 250-1,400 PFU.#546
Humans exposed intranasally to ~70 PFU of seasonal coronavirus 229E developed infections, with a plausible intranasal ID50 of 10 TCID50 (~7 PFU).#78, 478 , 96
The inhalation infectious dose of seasonal coronavirus 229E is unknown in humans.#
The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).#155, 158
Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) between 100-500,000 PFU show signs of infection.#19, 141, 388, 767
Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.#19, 141, 388, 767
SARS-CoV-2 is passed easily between humans through close contact and aerosol transmission.#36, 83, 266, 464
As of 12/21/2020, pandemic COVID-19 has caused at least 77,074,469 infections and 1,697,679 deaths globally.#318 
In the US, there have been 17,862,876 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 317,858 confirmed deaths, though both cases and fatalities are underestimates.#318, 498, 733 , 33
Estimates of human transmissibility (R0) range from 2.2 to 3.1.#433, 514, 576, 740, 766
SARS-CoV-2 can spread via aerosol or “airborne” transmission beyond 6 ft in certain situations such as enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation.#724, 110 
The risk of airborne infection from fomites is believed to be low.#281
Exhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per person per hour; the amount of infectious virus remains unknown.#429
Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible but rare.#193, 680,651
Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals can transmit SARS-CoV-2 and contribute significantly to new case growth.#391 
Individuals may be infectious for 1-3 days prior to symptom onset.#41, 705 
Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2.#50, 300, 428 ,417,72, 344, 628, 639, 745, 770 
Between 15-56% of infections may be caused by pre- symptomatic transmission.#568,100, 283, 413, 765 
75.9% of transmission events in China were associated with pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission.#616 
Most transmission occurs before symptoms begin and within 5 days of symptom onset.#127
Asymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection.#638 
There is evidence that asymptomatic individuals transmit SARS-CoV-2 less often than symptomatic individuals.#65, 87, 647
Infection risk is particularly high indoors.#59
SARS-CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation in indoor areas such as restaurants.#396,11, 385, 599, 631 
Positive SARS- CoV-2 patients were twice as likely as negative patients to report that they had recently eaten in restaurants or worked in an office.#215,220 
Clusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings, including bars, restaurants, and gyms.#123,376, 515,758
Very few outbreaks have occurred in outdoor settings.#88
Household transmission is rapid, and household contacts spread infection more than casual community contacts.#482, 16
On average, 16.6% to 18% of household contacts of infected index patients acquire SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., the “attack rate”).#430, 342
Attack rates are higher for symptomatic index cases, spouses of index cases, and adults, though transmission to children may be underestimated.#26,430 
75% of household infections occurred within 5 days of illness onset in the index case.#262
In a US study, 31 of 58 households (54%) with a primary SARS-CoV-2 case showed evidence of secondary transmission; in 7 of these 31 households (23%), all members of the household became infected.#386
Index patients who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to secondary contacts had higher viral titers than secondary contacts who did not subsequently transmit illness, as quantified by nasal swab RT-qPCR.#329
Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread.#15,188, 368, 373, 691
Most new infections come from a few infectious individuals (overdispersion parameter k = 0.2-0.5).#15, 188, 368, 373, 691
Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low, but the US CDC recommends masks during travel.#250,613
Several studies have identified plausible transmission on airplanes.#49, 133, 288, 336, 471 
Fluorescent tracer research on commercial airplanes suggests a low risk of aerosol or surface transmission during flights, though key parameters remain uncertain.#619 
On trains in China, transmission rates were high for those in the same row as an infectious individual (1.5-3.5% attack rate), though low for non-neighboring passengers.#296 
Outbreaks have also occurred on public buses.#427
Children of any age can acquire and transmit infection in homes, schools, and community settings, though there is some evidence that younger children (<10-15) are less susceptible and less infectious than older children and adults.#
The role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is unclear. #
There is evidence of high transmission rates among same-aged children, as well as transmission in the home, at school, and in the community.#287, 539, 373, 304, 372, 386, 516, 263, 313
However, there have also been suggestions that children are both less susceptible to COVID-19 (due to low PCR test positivity rates)430 and less infectious (because they are rarely identified as the index case in households).#779
Some emerging evidence suggests that young children (<10) are less susceptible and less infectious than adults, while older children and adolescents are more similar to adults.#251 
Contact tracing in China, Iceland, and Israel has found lower rates of transmission to and from younger children (<10-15) compared to adults, but similar rates in older children.#153, 519, 641 
After schools reopened in Italy, researchers found low attack rates in preschool (0%) and elementary school children (0.38%), but higher attack rates in middle and high school students (6.5%).#362 
Discrepancies regarding the susceptibility and infectivity of children may be partly explained by age.#
Children are also less likely than adults to test positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR despite being infected, underestimating pediatric COVID-19 infections.#180, 658,153,444,714 
Serological studies in Germany, Spain, and Italy found high rates of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in children, though the finding is not ubiquitous.#286,65,656,85 
Separating the effects of differential susceptibility, infectivity, test positivity, and testing likelihood by age is crucial to understand the role of children.#444
Individuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID-19 are unlikely to be infectious.#403, 749
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. #
Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.#394, 408, 410 
Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.#73
Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS-CoV-1, with a suggested bat origin.#142, 776,776
Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source, though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.#60, 143, 744, 757,113
Viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago, and pangolins positive for coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.#393,358 
However, SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003.#
Experiments show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor-binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS-CoV-1, potentially explaining its high transmissibility.#736
Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range, in addition to receptor binding.#445
Modeling suggests a wide range of animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2, though experimental studies are still needed.#151
Animals can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans, but the potential role of long-term reservoir species is unknown.#
Infected mink have been linked to human infections in workers at mink farms.#505
In the US, researchers experimentally exposed big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) to SARS-CoV-2 via the oropharyngeal and nasal route and found no subsequent signs of infection, clinical symptoms, or transmission.#274
Several animal species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.#
Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters and ferrets are susceptible to infection.#120, 339 
In the Netherlands, farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 infection.#1 
SARS-CoV-2 cases in mink on US farms show high mortality rates, and farms have implemented strict biosecurity measures.#361 
Infected mink in the US have been linked to human infections.#3
Several non-human primates are also susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 including cynomolgus macaques, African green monkeys, and Rhesus macaques.#422,580,734
Raccoon dogs (mammals related to foxes) are susceptible to COVID-19 (105 intranasal exposure dose) and were shown to transmit infection to other raccoon dogs in neighboring enclosures.#233
Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (100,000-520,000 PFU via the intranasal route or a combination of routes), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short-distance aerosol.#615,273
Wild cats (tigers and lions) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.#704,435, 763 
Studies have confirmed that human keepers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo.#58 
Two cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in pet domestic cats.#105
Deer mice can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal exposure (104 or 105 TCID50) and are able to transmit virus to uninfected deer mice through direct contact.#258,194 
The capacity of deer mice as a reservoir species is unknown.#
Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS-CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens, 100,000 PFU for pigs, ~70,000 PFU for pigs and chickens all via intranasal route).#600 ,615 
When pigs were inoculated by the oronasal route (106 PFU), minimal to no signs of clinical disease were noted, suggesting limited transmission concerns.#536
Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 after experimental exposures.#637
Rabbits do not exhibit clinical symptoms after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but do seroconvert.#473
Cattle exposed to SARS-CoV-2 showed no clinical disease but exhibited low levels of viral shedding in the nose, which could be residual virus from the exposure dose.#668
Dogs exposed to SARS-CoV-2 produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies but exhibited no clinical symptoms.#615, 624,74
In Italy, approximately 3-6% of domestic dogs and cats showed detectable neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though no animals showed clinical signs or positive RT-PCR tests in addition to the antibodies, and no evidence exists of transmission from dogs or cats to humans.#522
survey of 334 pangolins did not identify coronavirus nucleic acid in ‘upstream’ market chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network.#379
These data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.#379
On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2-14 days.# 
Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset.# 
Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease.#
By general consensus, the incubation period of COVID-19 is between 5 and 6 days.#750 , 369, 706 
Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.#369 
However, more recent estimates using different models calculate a longer incubation period, between 7 and 8 days.#549 
This could mean that 5-10% of individuals undergoing a 14- day quarantine are still infectious at the end.#549
There is evidence that younger (<14) and older (>75) individuals have longer COVID-19 incubation periods, creating a U- shaped relationship between incubation period length and patient age while adolescent and young adult populations (15-24 years old) have been estimated at ~2 days.#398,345
Individuals can test positive for COVID-19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.#50, 119, 267, 650, 770
Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic, and asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.#41, 337, 781,111, 586, 650, 770 
Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.#283 
Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.#41
It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset.#
A systematic review of published studies on SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV found none that reported isolation of infectious virus from COVID-19 patients beyond 9 days from symptom onset, despite high viral loads by genetic tests.#118
While the amount of virus needed to infect another individual is unknown, mild-moderate COVID-19 cases appear to be infectious for no longer than 10 days after symptom onset, while severely ill or immunocompromised patients may be infectious for 20-70 days after symptom onset;#46 
individuals can also transmit infection before symptoms appear.#685
Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.#297
The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days.#
On average, there are approximately 4 to 7.5 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). #179, 389
Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China and additional meta-analysis, the mean serial interval is between 4.4 and 6.0 days.#178, 551, 750
The serial interval of COVID-19 has declined substantially over time as a result of increased case isolation, meaning individuals tend to transmit virus for less time.#24
The generation time (time between infection events in a chain of transmission) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated as 4-5 days.#259 
Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious.#
Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).#425
Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 take less time to test negative than severely ill patients.#380
Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals may take longer to develop symptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals.#706
Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two weeks after symptoms begin.#684 
The duration of the infectious period is unknown, though patients can test positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples.#684
Patients being released from the hospital may still exhale detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (~7,000 genome copies per hour), though the infectivity of these patients is unknown.#775
Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.#8 
Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.#503 
Fever is most often the first symptom.#
Most symptomatic COVID-19 cases are mild (81%).#650, 726 
Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms, followed by malaise, fatigue, and sputum/secretion.#150 ,39, 267,112, 124, 298
In at least one cohort, however (n=1,564), muscle pain (55%) and headache (51%) were more common than cough (49%).#191 
Chills, muscle pain, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological symptoms, and dermatological symptoms also occur with COVID-19, and atypical symptoms such as unexplained limb pain may also present with COVID-19.#145, 470 , 115, 524, 746,582,402,150,112
Headaches are common, may persist for weeks, and may be associated with shorter disease duration.#99
In children, loss of taste or smell, nausea or vomiting, headache, and fever were predictive of COVID-19 infection.#340 
Children were less likely to exhibit cough and loss of taste or smell than adults, but more likely to show sore throat.#372
COVID-19 generally begins with fever, then cough and malaise.#363 
In 49 children with COVID-19 (0-22 years), however, only 51% developed fever.#755 
Only 20% of emergency department patients testing positive for COVID-19 had fevers >100°F.#678 
In older patients, delirium should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 with or without other typical signs.#333
COVID-19 is more severe than seasonal influenza, evidenced by higher ICU admission and mortality rates.#538,743
Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe, and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.#267, 650 
Symptoms can persist for months.#
Higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads on admission have been associated with greater risk of death.#431, 712 
Individuals of any age can develop severe symptoms and require ICU care.#506 
Males are associated with worse outcomes compared to females.#526
Early presenters, who are admitted to the hospital within 7 days of symptom onset, have worse clinical outcomes than those admitted later in illness, potentially due to an observed hyperinflammatory response 5-7 days after symptoms begin.#467,727
SARS-CoV-2 attacks blood vessels in the lung, leading to clotting complications and ARDS.#14, 676 , 91
Clotting affects multiple organs and is present in 15-27% of cases.#424,557 
COVID-19 also causes pneumonia, cardiac injury, secondary infection, kidney damage, pancreatitis, arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke, respiratory complications, and shock.#267, 298, 687, 773,510,617,40, 636,30,446, 530,669
COVID-19 symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath commonly persist for weeks to months after initial onset.#649, 98
Most (88%) individuals infected with COVID-19 (n=86) showed evidence of lung damage six weeks after clinical recovery.#268 
Approximately 9% of hospitalized patients experience at least 1 hospital readmission (from any cause) within 2 months of COVID-19 recovery, with individuals over 65 showing slightly higher odds of readmission.#370
Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection, though changing symptom definitions make it difficult to compare asymptomatic fractions through time.#447,87, 93, 359, 371, 380, 454, 487, 502, 644, 660
The case fatality rate (CFR) is unknown, but adults >60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.#650, 773 , 520
Cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, down syndrome, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.#650, 773 , 17, 532,761,692,139
Prior kidney disease may increase disease severity, though age may be the dominant factor.#491,495
The CFR increases with age (data from China and Italy) 0-19 years < 0.2%; 20-29 years = 0-0.2%, 30-39 years = 0.2-0.3%, 40-49 years = 0.4%, 50-59 years 1.0-1.3%, 60-69 years = 3.5-3.6%, 70-79 years = 8.0-12.8%, >80 years = 14.8-20.2%.#500
In Iceland, the overall CFR has been estimated at 0.3-0.6% but increases to ~4% in those over 70 years old.#269 
An estimated overall infection fatality rate for Indiana was calculated as 0.26%, increasing to 1.71% for those >65 years old.#70
Minority populations and essential workers are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.#463
Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic populations, including children, acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups and are hospitalized and die disproportionately.#290, 448,52, 224, 257, 509, 545,240, 548
Hispanic and Black COVID-19 patients tend to die at younger ages than white patients.#735 
Hispanic, Black, and American Indian children accounted for 78% of early US pediatric deaths (n=121).#69 
Social vulnerability is associated with greater SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.#152
Pregnant women with COVID-19 require ICU care at similar rates as non-pregnant women and are less likely to present with fever and myalgia, but have higher rates of preterm delivery.#26,732 
Severity in pregnant women may be associated with underlying conditions such as obesity, and symptom severity may be predicted early.#26,457 
Preterm births are more likely in symptomatic patients.#160 
Approximately 25% of pregnant COVID-19 patients had symptoms for at least 8 weeks.#18
In the UK, healthcare workers are >7 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 than non-essential employees.#472 
Children are susceptible to COVID-19, though generally show milder or no symptoms.#174,125, 423
21% to 28% of children (<19 years old) may be asymptomatic.#423, 518, 550 
Most symptomatic children show mild or moderate symptoms.#256, 518 
Severe symptoms in children and infants are more likely in those with complex medical histories.#611,412,86, 423 
WHO and US CDC have identified a rare condition in children (Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome, MIS-C) linked to COVID-19 infection.#577, 659,723 ,317,248
The prevalence of Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome MIS-Cis unknown. #
Children with both severe and moderate initial symptoms can progress to MIS-C.#247 
Black children are overrepresented among MIS-C patients.#378
Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.#29, 718 
Reinfection is possible.# 
The longevity of antibody responses and T-cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several months.#
In a study of healthcare workers in the UK, those with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from prior exposure (n=1,167) were protected from reinfection for a median of 127 days (no symptomatic reinfection, 3 subsequent positive PCR tests).#426
Researchers have found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating in patients for 3-6 months after infection.#211, 269, 579, 581 
Mild COVID-19 infections can induce detectable immune responses for at least 3 months.#581 
Antibody levels increase with disease severity and are largely unaffected by patient age.#654,211 
A UK study found evidence of antibody levels waning after 4-6 months, though the study looked at population-level seroprevalence and not individual antibody levels.#702
Neutralizing antibody responses are present within 8-19 days after symptom onset and can persist for months.#416, 643,683 
Individuals with more severe infections developed higher neutralizing antibody levels that persisted longer than those with asymptomatic or mild infections.#606 
The antibody IgM appears to contribute substantially to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing ability, with IgG also contributing to a lesser extent.#242 
Asymptomatic cases generate weaker antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.#132
Antibody levels declined in 156 healthcare workers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 28% dropping below detectable levels when tested after 60 days, suggesting caution in single time-point assays to detect prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.#605
Strong, early inflammatory immune responses are associated with more severe clinical presentation.#161 
There appear to be several distinct immunological phenotypes associated with COVID-19, with cytokine storm syndrome present in ~3-4% of patients.#468 
A more common phenotype is characterized by a lack of Type I interferon response and general immunosuppression, which may help to explain variability in corticosteroid treatment effects.#468
SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells are involved in the human immune response, and provide evidence of B cell-mediated immunity after mild-moderate COVID-19 infection.#497 
T-cell responses may persist for at least 6 months, though they appear stronger in individuals with more severe COVID-19 cases.#782 
While memory B and T cells both persist for at least 6 months, there is some variability in the persistence of specific antibodies (e.g., IgG vs. IgA). #235, 614
Immune responses appear to differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.#374
asymptomatic patients appear to mount robust T-cell responses, express higher levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2, and have more coordinated production of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines than symptomatic patients.#374
In a 35-year study of 10 men, reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses occurred 1-3 years after initial infection.#184 
Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.#95, 741
Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is possible but appears rare, though the true frequency is unknown.#
Researchers in Hong Kong and the US have identified COVID-19 reinfections.#349,653 
Reinfections have been either less or more severe than the initial infection.#349,653 
The infectiousness of re-infected individuals is unknown.#
Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques, with re-challenge 28 days or 35 days after initial exposure resulting in no clinical symptoms.#165,122

The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS-CoV-2 immunity is unknown.#481
Cross-reactivity in T-cell responses between other human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 may explain some variation in symptom severity among patients.#440 
Key components of the human immune response (memory B cells) are activated by SARS-CoV-2, and may persist for decades to offset any waning antibody immunity.#484
Cross-reactivity from seasonal coronaviruses also enhances the immune response toward the S2 unit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.#484
Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVID-19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.#81, 261 
These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells of ~30-40% of unexposed patients, suggesting some cross-reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.#81, 261 
Long-lasting T-cell responses have been seen in SARS-CoV-1 patients, and T-cell cross- reactivity between other coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 suggest additional immune protection.#375
Children do not appear to be protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection by historical exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.#607 
Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, though there has been some cross-reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.#662,544
Diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID-19, PCR-based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. #
Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable.#
As of 12/16/2020, the FDA has granted EUAs to 303 diagnostic tests, including 231 molecular, 62 antibody, and 10 antigen tests, which include one for detecting neutralizing antibodies from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and at-home diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection.#228,229,226,195

The US CDC recommends that anyone who has been in contact with a positive COVID-19 case should be tested.#116
The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. #
The false-negative rate for RT-PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give false-negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.#354 
Low viral loads can lead to false-negative RT-PCR tests, and viral loads are lower in late stage infections as well as at the end of a given day.#406
The duration of PCR-detectable viral samples is longer in the lower respiratory tract than the upper respiratory tract; nasopharyngeal sampling is most effective (89%) between 0 and 4 days after symptom onset but falls significantly (to 54%) by 10 to 14 days.#436 
After 10 days, alternative testing methods (e.g., lower respiratory samples) may be necessary.#436
Symptom-based screening at airports was ineffective at detecting cases (9 identified out of 766,044 passengers screened), and intensive screening on a US military base during mandatory quarantine did not identify any COVID-19 cases.#383,173

Exclusively testing symptomatic healthcare workers is likely to exclude a large fraction of COVID-19 positive personnel.#635
Research has shown high variability in the ability of tests by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases.#365, 713 
Meta-analysis suggests that lateral flow assays (LFIA) are less accurate than ELISA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target of serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.#404 
The FDA has excluded several dozen serological diagnostic assays based on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.#200
In a study with pregnant women, rapid antibody (lateral flow assay) testing resulted in a 50% positive predictive value and 50% false positive rate, which are lower than the values touted for non-pregnant populations.#192
SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for COVID-19 surveillance, and can warn of SARS-CoV-2 cases ahead of positive PCR tests and hospital admissions.#525,21
There is no universally effective treatment for COVID-19, but some treatments reduce disease severity and mortality.# 
Remdesivir may reduce symptom duration in hospitalized patients, and may reduce mortality when combined with other treatment regimens (e.g., baricitinab).#327,63

Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients, especially if given early.#657,512,126
Dexamethasone is associated with substantial reductions in mortality for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, smaller benefits for those receiving supplemental oxygen, and no benefits in patients who did not need oxygen or ventilation.#293
A large meta-analysis found that 28-day mortality in critically ill patients was reduced in patients (n=678) who received systemic corticosteroids.633 Four separate, smaller trials of corticosteroids (n<152) were stopped early.#38, 167, 390, 655
The benefits of glucocorticoids may depend heavily on patient inflammation.#330 
In several studies, high doses of steroids were associated with elevated mortality, though low-moderate doses can reduce mortality in patients with ARDS.#738,405, 461
Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and may be effective when administered early, though evidence is mixed.#27,523
A large trial of plasma therapy (>25,000 patients) shows that treatment is safe, with some evidence that it can reduce 7-day mortality.#305, 324 
Plasma therapy shows larger reductions in mortality when administered within 44 hours of hospital admission, and donor plasma with higher antibody levels appears more effective.#596,325, 438, 558 
Even high-titer donor plasma, however, did not substantially improve outcomes in a clinical trial with severe COVID-19 patients (n=228).#621
On 8/24/2020, the US FDA approved an Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent plasma therapy.#207
Anticoagulants may reduce COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients.#
Both therapeutic and prophylactic use of anticoagulants has been associated with significant (~50%) reduction in mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.#476 
Anticoagulant use was associated with lower mortality in the severely ill, but the correct dose is critical to avoid complications.#311,513 
High doses of anticoagulants may be effective in critically ill patients.#323 
Patients 65 years and up receiving chronic anticoagulant treatment showed higher survival than propensity-matched controls.#162
The benefits of tocilizumab are unclear, and it can increase hospital stay time and the risk of secondary infection.#386
While tocilizumab appears to show a 12% reduction in mortality in treated patients, a randomized clinical trial found no effects on mortality, and other evidence suggests that it may be beneficial only in certain circumstances.#434,285, 458, 477, 634,284
Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated but results from large clinical trials are needed.#
Eli Lilly has received Emergency Use Authorization from the US FDA for its monoclonal antibody product, bamlanivimab, for use in recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.#400 
Regeneron’s REGN-COV2 monoclonal antibody has been associated with reductions in symptom duration.#563 
However, data from both Eli Lilly and Regeneron suggest that their monoclonal antibody treatments may not work well for hospitalized patients or those with high oxygen requirements.#562,401
Regeneron received Emergency Use Authorization for an antibody cocktail to treat mild/moderate COVID-19 patients.#564

At the final study endpoint (170 confirmed COVID-19 cases out of 43,000 participants), vaccine showed 95% efficacy at 7 days after the second vaccine dose (28 days after first dose), which was consistent across age, sex, race, and ethnicity.#534
Efficacy was 94% for those individuals over 65.#534
There were study participants, with 162 cases (9 severe) in the placebo group and 8 cases (1 severe) in vaccine group.#534,43,661 
Safety was assessed in children (n=100, 12-15 years old), racially and ethnically diverse patients (30-42% of trial pool), and individuals 56-85 years old (41-45% of participants).#535 
No serious safety concerns were observed, and adverse events included fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2.0%).#535 
Other common side effects included pain at the injection site and muscle pain.#535
After reports of two allergic reactions in UK healthcare workers, the US CDC concluded that individuals with known allergies to foods, latex, or pollen (for instance) do not have to take special precautions for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, but should talk to their doctor and be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination.#585,441
Storage and shipping requirements are -70°C; once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to 5 days at refrigerated (2–8°C) conditions.#535

Broad-scale control measures such as stay-at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously.# 
Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.#219 
Social distancing and other policies quickly reduced spread throughout China, Europe, and the US.#348,350, 353, 356, 419, 432, 690 , 243, 328
In China, modeling suggests that a one-day delay in implementing control measures increased the time needed to curtail an outbreak by 2.4 days.#177 
In the US, each day of delay in emergency declarations and school closures was associated with a 5-6% increase in mortality.#753 
Reductions in transmission are generally visible 6-9 days after the implementation of NPIs, and increased transmission is generally visible 14-20 days after NPIs are lifted.#395
US counties with mask mandates have lower case growth rates than neighboring counties lacking mask mandates.#609 
Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission even when individual mask efficiency is low, though their benefits are maximized when most of the population wears masks.#221,483,185
In the US, shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.#146 
School closures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.#146 
Similarly, more public health interventions in a given week was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 growth rates in the next week.#326 
Adherence to social distancing policies depends on income.#707 
Telework policies may reduce new cases.#215
Mobility and physical contact rates decline after public health control measures are implemented.#222, 364,316 
Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with significant reductions in COVID-19 case growth.#48, 278 
Social distancing and reductions in both non-essential visits to stores and overall movement distance led to lower transmission rates.#466
A combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are likely required to effectively limit transmission.#210, 346 
School closures alone appear insufficient, though likely reduced mortality in the UK and the US.#314, 356,45, 571
Reducing capacity at crowded indoor locations such as restaurants, gyms, hotels, cafes, and religious organizations may be an effective way to reduce COVID-19 transmission without more substantial lockdowns.#123 
Increasing air flow rates in indoor environments, improving mechanical filtration efficiency, and wearing masks may also reduce indoor transmission rates.#334
Adolescents and young adults (15-24) may require different messaging to improve adherence to NPIs and public health policies, and self-reported adherence to NPI policies (e.g., mask use) is consistently low in 18- to 29-year-olds.#271,303 
In the US, limiting transmission in younger populations is crucial for reducing hospitalizations and mortality in older cohorts.#504
Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 infection.#524
The US CDC has indicated that face masks inhibit transmission by both reducing the number of exhaled particles from infectious individuals, as well as reducing the number of inhaled particles when worn by uninfected individuals.#109 
The US CDC recommends universal masking when indoors to inhibit the spread of COVID-19, alongside physical distancing, avoiding nonessential indoor and crowded outdoor spaces, postponing travel, and increasing ventilation and disinfection.#291
Always wearing masks, maintaining physical distance >1m, and frequently washing hands were all associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 infection in individuals who had direct contact with infected individuals.#176
Particle physics modeling suggests that 2m physical distancing is generally sufficient for reduction of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols expressed during coughs, though smaller particles can travel farther, and wind direction and speed may play a role.#292
A Danish study found that mask use was not associated with protection from COVID-19 infection, but suffered from limitations in timing (i.e., low COVID-19 prevalence) and self-reporting, and did not assess reductions in emission rates.#89
Particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.#729
Retrospective contact tracing may help identify the source of large clusters of cases, and should be implemented due to the overdispersion or heterogeneity in secondary transmission arising from each primary COVID-19 case.#117
There are multiple types of superspreading events, and different policies are required to mitigate risks from each.#28 
Research is needed to plan the path to SARS-CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.# 
In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing, and quarantine was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19.#639 
Contact tracing and high levels of testing and physical distancing352 may limit COVID-19 resurgence.#23, 213
Premature relaxation of public health control measures may facilitate rapid increases in prevalence at the state level.#236
Modeling suggests that periods of social distancing or lock-down may be effective in reducing exposure from asymptomatic cases.#661 
Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.#661 
Rolling interventions may be necessary.#751
Undetected cases can lead to elevated risk of re-emergence after restrictions are lifted.#276
Synchronizing public health interventions across US state lines may reduce the total number of required interventions.#587
Modeling shows that travel restrictions are likely to have the greatest impact at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in countries that are highly connected to those with high incidence, and also in countries with low incidence.#589
SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity.#61
Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans.#
Viable SARS-CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies.#
Both temperature and humidity contribute to SARS-CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).#68
Persistence is reduced with warmer temperatures (37°C), and enhanced at colder temperatures (4°C).#277
SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be stable up to 7 days (25-27°C; 35% RH) on smooth surfaces, to include plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical masks.#414 
At 22°C, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be detectable (via plaque assay) on paper currency for up to 24 hours, on clothing for up to 4 hours, and on skin for up to 96 hours.#277
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be stable across pH 3-10 on several surfaces at 22°C.#130 
After 3 hours (22°C, 65% RH), no infectious virus was detected on printing and tissue papers; on day 2, none was found on treated wood and cloth; on day 4, none was found on glass or banknote; on day 7, none was found on stainless steel or plastic.#130
At standard room temperature and humidity, SARS-CoV-2 becomes undetectable on common library items after 2 to 8 days of quarantine depending on the material (e.g., book cover vs leather) and conditions (e.g., stacked vs unstacked).#7, 308, 608
SARS-CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces for up to 3 days (21-23°C, 40% RH) and infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22°C, 65% RH).#130,673
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days.#465
It is estimated that at least 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 are needed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces.#517
In the absence of sunlight, SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks.#
In the absence of sunlight, infectious SARS-CoV-2 can remain on non-porous (e.g., glass, vinyl) surfaces for at least 28 days at 20°C and 50% RH; higher temperatures greatly reduce the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2.#575 
This value is longer than other stability estimates, potentially due to a fluid matrix with more protein to simulate human respiratory fluid and a higher inoculation dose.#575,131, 575, 673 
In simulated saliva on stainless steel surfaces, SARS-CoV-2 shows negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8-12.8 minutes, depending on simulated UVB radiation.#559
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data-based model for SARS-CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity without sunlight.#169
Particulate matter (PM) does not appear to be a viable transmission model of SARS-CoV-2.#
It does not appear that pollen or air particulates are carriers of SARS-CoV-2, despite some country-level associations.#181,55 
SARS-CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature.#
DHS has developed a tool for estimating the decay of airborne SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.#168 
Due to the effects of evaporation, modeling suggests that hot, dry conditions increase the aerosol risk of SARS-CoV-2, though cold, humid conditions facilitate transmission by droplet spread.#769
Experimental studies using SARS-CoV-2 aerosols (1.78-1.96 μm mass median aerodynamic diameter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high-intensity sunlight (similar to mid-June) and 19 minutes in low-intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October).#602 
In dark conditions, the half-life of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matrix.#602 
Humidity alone had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.#602
SARS-CoV-2 was shown to have an aerosol half-life of 2.7 hours (without sunlight, particles <5 μm, tested at 21-23°C and 65% RH),673 retaining infectivity for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23°C, 53% RH, no sunlight).#208
Stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperature and transport medium.#
RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18-25°C or 2-8°C for up to 21 days without impacting real-time RT-PCR results.#625 
RNA in clinical samples is also stable at 4°C for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT-PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL).# 
Separately, storage of RNA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (18-25°C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.#528
There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food.#
There is no documented evidence that food, food packaging, or food handling is a significant source of COVID-19 infections, though several outbreaks have a hypothesized food origin.#275,310, 716 
Infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been found on frozen food packaging, but has not been linked to actual infections.#569
SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70°C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4°C).#131, 556 
SARS-CoV-2 maintains infectivity for at least 21 days when inoculated on frozen foods and stored below -20°C.#218
Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine-based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on hands and surfaces.#
A systematic review identified sunlight, UV light, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite as methods to reduce surface contamination.#61 
However, the levels of decontamination necessary to affect transmission per se are still unknown.#61
Alcohol-based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2.#351
Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.#129
EPA has released a list of SARS-CoV-2 disinfectants that have been found effective against SARS-CoV-2 specifically.#189
Twice-daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID-19 patient hospital rooms.#501
Regular disinfection of hospital rooms (with benzalkonium wipes) can reduce the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, though contamination is widespread without regular cleaning.#338 
Chlorhexidine digluconate may be ineffective.#43

Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS-CoV-2.# 
Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19, even with recommended PPE.#
Healthcare worker illnesses650 demonstrates human-to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.#601
Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high.#566 
Contacts with healthcare workers tend to transmit COVID-19 more often than other casual contacts.#698 
Hospital-acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive infection control measures, including expanded testing and use of PPE for all patient contacts.#574 
Universal masking policies also reduced the rate of new healthcare worker infections.#697, 778 
Even among healthcare personnel reporting adequate PPE early in the pandemic (March-April), rates of infection were 3.4 times higher than the general population.#485
A modeling study suggests that healthcare workers are primarily at risk from droplet and inhalation exposure (compared to contact with fomites), with greater risk while in closer proximity to patients.#322
The WHO considers face shields as inferior to masks and respirators for control of droplet transmission.#722
Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS-CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).#107
WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long-sleeve gowns as well as gloves.#719 
PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.#209, 710
Respirators (NIOSH-certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those working with potential aerosols.#721
Additional protection (Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with hood), should be considered for high-risk procedures.#84
KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.#199 
On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.#205

The US FDA cautions healthcare facilities using passive protective barrier enclosures without negative pressure, and has withdrawn a prior Emergency Use Authorization for the devices.#203
Experiments with mannequins show that face masks reduce potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 when worn by an infectious individual, but also that face masks by non-infected recipients can reduce the number of inhaled particles; the protective effect was maximized when both infected and uninfected individuals (mannequins) wore masks.#667
Researchers have developed a lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that prevents SARS-CoV-2 transmission in ferrets given the peptide prophylactically via the intranasal route; human studies have yet to be conducted.#157
Non-medical masks may be effective at slowing transmission, though data specific to SARS-CoV-2 are sparse.#6, 9
On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.#108 
The CDC recommends masks without exhalation vents or valves, as masks with valves can allow particles to pass through unfiltered.#103,677 
The WHO recommends that the general population wear non-medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly) wear medical masks when close contact is likely.#717 
Infected individuals wearing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.#700
A meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and COVID-19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of transmission, with N95 respirators more effective than surgical masks.#135 
In a separate meta-analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.#496 
N95 respirators were associated with up to 80% reductions in SARS-CoV-1 infections.#496
Surgical face masks, respirators, and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals to other individuals.#154, 384, 671 
Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus expressed as aerosol particles (<5 μm).#384 
Homemade masks reduce overall flow from breathing and coughing (63-86% reduction) but also generate leakage jets facing downward and backward from the wearer’s face.#679
Some non-standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3μm, while other materials (e.g., T-shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35-62%).#689,343 
Of 42 homemade materials tested, the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers.#759 
Neck fleeces commonly worn by runners may increase the frequency of small aerosol particles, compared to wearing no mask at all.#214 
Cotton T-shirt masks appear ineffective at reducing emitted particles when individuals talk, breathe, sneeze, or cough, with those made of single layers increasing emitted particles during these activities.#42 
Smaller aerosol particles (e.g., <0.1μm) are more difficult to filter for most respirators and face masks.#136
All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS-CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species.#
New analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related SARS-like coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without the influence of an intermediate 'mixing' host.#73 
Pangolin coronaviruses were shown to be more divergent and split off from bat coronaviruses earlier than SARS-CoV-2.#73 
Current sampling of pangolin viruses does not implicate them as an intermediate to human SARS-CoV-2.#73 
These data suggest SARS-CoV-2 emerged from circulating bat coronaviruses in SE China/SE Asia and additional zoonotic emergence of novel coronaviruses could occur.#
Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 most likely emerged from Rhinolophus (horseshoe) bats living in China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, or another Southeast Asian country, though historical recombination with pangolin coronaviruses may explain some features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.#225,366
Genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human-derived or otherwise created by “recombination” with other circulating strains of coronavirus.#35, 776
Phylogenetics suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolins.#408, 410 
The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is a major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein.#420 
The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat coronaviruses and coronaviruses found in pangolins.#420,410
Deletion mutants were identified at low levels in human clinical samples, suggesting that the PRRA furin cleavage site alone is not fully responsible for human infection, but does confer a fitness advantage in the human host.#731 
Additional whole- genome sequencing in humans would help to confirm this finding.#
Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS-CoV-2 “(i) natural selection in a non-human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.”#35 
Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS-CoV-2 isolates.#
Some SARS-CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses, and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta-coronaviruses.#408, 410,730 
Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bats could be the source of SARS-CoV-2.#392, 742 
Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS-like coronaviruses.#764 
There are multiple studies showing that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.#35, 392, 409, 764 
These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. #35, 392, 409, 764
A key difference between SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).#147
A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion between the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein.# 
While distinct from the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.#774
Additionally, “[...] SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,” reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination, and “[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.”#35
Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.#156
A report claiming a laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been heavily disputed by scientists at Johns Hopkins University.#4,748
Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine-learning has identified key genomic signatures shared among high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.#272 
These data further suggest that SARS-CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.#272
Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses.#
There have been no documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 prior to December 2019.# 
Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS-CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 – 12/17/2019.#37, 60, 554
The estimated mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 is 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.#674
SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing purifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).#737
Low genetic diversity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts, and that additional jumps into humans may occur.#737
In an analysis of ~3,500 COVID-19 patients, researchers identified 17 SARS-CoV-2 genome variants that were consistently associated with severe illness, and 67 SARS-CoV-2 genome variants consistently associated with mild disease.#682 
The variants were not rare overall, suggesting use as a screening tool, though a single variant alone is not necessarily responsible for virulence.#682 
Variants leading to the most severe illness were located in the C-terminal end of the Spike protein.#682
Several viral variants, representing unique collections of mutations, are being investigated for their effects on transmission and/or virulence.#
Phylogenetic and clinical analysis suggests the D614G mutation in the Spike protein is associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but no change in clinical severity in infected patients.#681,347 
An ongoing study of SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals the continued spread and increased presence of sequences with the D614G mutation, though it is possible that founder effects contributed to its prevalence.#347, 418, 540, 762,675 
Limited animal model results support the possibility of increased transmissibility, and the mutation slightly increased viral replication in human cell lines.#295, 541,540, 762 
Broad phylogenetic analysis, however, suggests that no current, recurring SARS-CoV-2 mutations (including D614G) are associated with higher rates of transmission in human populations.#675
The D614G mutation appears to make the virus more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies or by convalescent plasma.#709 
Antibodies induced by the D614G mutation or wild-type virus are able to neutralize each other.#377
A separate Spike protein receptor binding motif variant (called N493K) results in similar clinical disease; importantly, it shows evidence of immune escape from polyclonal sera and neutralizing antibodies.#
This may affect the ability of vaccines and therapeutics that target this region.#652 
As of October 2020, this is the second most common receptor binding domain variant worldwide, and has been found in 12 countries.#652
An existing variant (VUI 202012/01) that is increasing in prevalence in some areas of the UK has been associated with higher transmission rates, though confirmation in human or animal studies is needed.#294 ,183
There have been no links between this variant (VUI 202012/01) and enhanced virulence.#437 
The variant (VUI 202012/01) consists of several mutations linked to the viral Spike protein and receptor-binding domain.#332,555
Several human genomic regions, including those determining blood type, affect COVID-19 prevalence and/or severity.#34
Blood type may affect COVID-19, with evidence of slightly increased prevalence and moderately increased severity in those with type A blood (though evidence is mixed).#367,249 ,31, 56, 252,289, 407
In US hospital patients, COVID-19 prevalence was slightly higher in individuals with non-O-type blood; blood type affected both risk of mechanical ventilation (lower in type A, higher in B and AB compared to O) and death (higher in AB, lower in A and B compared to O), and Rh negative status was protective for all three measures.#780 
Non-O-type blood has been associated with clotting issues.#166 
A large study (n=225,556) found that individuals with type O blood had less severe disease and lower risk of death from COVID-19 than individuals with other blood types, and that Rh-negative status showed lower COVID-19 prevalence.#560
Other regions associated with severe disease include locus 3p21.31, where certain alleles are found more often in patients with respiratory distress requiring ventilation, as well as those with severe disease.#507,249
Individuals with defective androgen signaling (long polyQ allelic repeats in the androgen receptor gene) were more likely to have severe COVID-19, possibly due to increased inflammatory responses; this may influence treatment decisions.#53
In a study of 2,244 critically ill COVID-19 patients, researchers identified novel associations between several genes involved in innate antiviral defenses (IFNAR2 and OAS) and host-driven inflammatory lung injury (DPP9, TYK2, and CCR2).#508 
Understanding the involvement of these genes could lead to targeted therapeutics; for instance, the development of baricitinab (or other Janus kinase inhibitors) to reduce inflammation caused by TYK2.#508
There is some concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 strains involved in continued human and mink transmission.#
Repeated outbreaks of COVID-19 on mink farms, and the detection of mink-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in humans, has led to the mass culling of all mink in Denmark.#570 
The State Serum Institute has noted mutations in the Spike protein that differed from commonly circulating strains and initially showed a decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.#309
The main SARS-CoV-2 variant associated with mink outbreaks in the Netherlands involves the Y453F mutation, which has also been identified in humans outside of Europe; this suggests the strain originated in humans.#144
